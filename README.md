📊 Student Rank Calculator – Python-Based Academic Analysis Tool

The Student Rank Calculator is a Python-based application developed as part of my Summer Training Program, designed to automate student performance evaluation and ranking using academic scores. The project focuses on applying data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to generate meaningful insights from student data.

The application supports both manual data entry and CSV-based input, making it flexible for real-world academic use cases.

🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the process of calculating student ranks by computing average scores across multiple subjects, assigning ranks using statistical methods, and presenting the results in both tabular and visual formats.
It demonstrates practical usage of Python, data analytics libraries, and basic UI interaction for educational data analysis.
